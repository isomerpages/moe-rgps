#### Traffic Matters
Please take note of the following traffic matters. Your cooperation and consideration will help to make arrival and dismissal safe and smooth for all.

**Students Walking to School**<br>
Students coming from the direction of the MRT station or Dunearn Road should enter the school by Gate 2A. From Gate 2A, students can access the hall and classrooms via the sheltered walkway and link bridge without crossing any roads.

**Drop-off & Pick-Up by Private Cars**<br>
Students can alight along the whole stretch from the canteen to the basketball court. This stretch can accommodate at least 10 cars at any one point, when parents ***drive forward as far as possible***. Students can also alight at Car Park C (see map below) and use the link bridge to access the hall and classrooms directly. Please ensure that your child/ward is ready to alight promptly when your car stops. Parents should not disembark from the car.<br><br>
Cars are allowed into the school for pick-ups at 1.40pm after the school buses leave. Cars are not allowed to wait outside the school before 1.35pm.***Please do not come too early and note that partial one-way traffic along Hillcrest Road operates from 1.00pm – 2.00pm and 4.30pm – 5.30 pm for CCAs.*** For school dismissal pick-ups, P1 to P4 parents should drive to the canteen pick-up point, while P5 and P6 parents should drive to the basketball court where the students gather to wait.
