#### **Dance (P3 to P6)**

##### **Overview of CCA**

Dance CCA is for Primary 3 to Primary 6 pupils who have an interest in dancing. Pupils have a chance to learn different movements and rhythms associated with Chinese, Indian and Modern dance. 

Our CCA have a recreational team and 3 school teams. Pupils have the opportunities to perform at school functions, such as Chinese New Year Celebration, Honours Day, and to participate in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Competitions.  Leadership and good values are also cultivated during activities as we believed in a holistic education.
