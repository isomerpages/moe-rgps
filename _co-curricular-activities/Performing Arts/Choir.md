The Choir provides a platform for girls who love to sing and aims to provide age-appropriate vocal training. The Choir also brings children together to rehearse and perform art and folk music of multiple cultures, languages, historical periods, and styles.  Singing with the choir will give pupils a forum to work together to bring to life music of great beauty and to share this achievement with others. This process of ensemble music making cultivates our members' sense of responsibility, commitment, self-discipline, confidence, and poise, key ingredients for success in any field of endeavor. We encourage our students to appreciate high standards of artistic excellence and to cultivate a love of beauty that can enrich each individual's experience for a lifetime. 

Pupils will have the opportunity to take part in various school functions as well as concerts outside of school.  The Choir also aims to provide pupils with the experience of performing both locally and internationally where possible.  The Choir also takes part in the Singapore Youth Festival among other competitions.

# Lower Primary Choir

In our junior choir, pupils learn basic singing techniques such as adopting the right singing posture, breath control and voice projection. Through singing activities and games, pupils will also learn musical concepts such as dynamics, rhythm-beating, pitching and solfeges. The weekly practices allow pupils to explore their voices, work in groups to create music and accompanying actions; and help them develop the ability to listen to and sing with one another.
