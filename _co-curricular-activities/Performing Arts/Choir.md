### **Choir (P3 to P6)**

#### **Main Choir (P4 to P6)**

##### **Overview of CCA**
The Choir comprises of pupils who are brought together by their love of singing and aims to provide age-appropriate vocal training.
 
In their continual exposure to music from various cultures, languages, historical periods, and styles, our choristers learn to appreciate artistic excellence and improve their musicality. They also develop responsibility, commitment, self-discipline, confidence, and poise – key ingredients for success in any field of endeavour. Most importantly, the choristers demonstrate teamwork as they learn to harmonise their voices to perform melodious works of beauty.

Our Choir will have the opportunity to perform in various school functions such as Honours Day, and out of school events such as the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.

#### **Junior Choir (P3)**

In junior choir, pupils learn basic singing techniques such as adopting the right singing posture, breath control and voice projection. Through singing activities and games, pupils will also learn musical concepts such as dynamics, rhythm-beating, pitching and solfeges. The weekly practices allow pupils to explore their voices, work in groups to create music and accompanying actions; and help them develop the ability to listen to and sing with one another. Students will also have opportunities to perform during school events and functions.
