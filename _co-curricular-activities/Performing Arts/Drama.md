#### **Drama Club (P3 to P6)**

##### **Overview of CCA**

The RGPS Drama Club aims to cultivate students’ appreciation for drama and will equip students with performing skills such as role-building, voice projection and audience awareness. Students will be actively involved in purposeful games and activities to develop their understanding and appreciation for drama. Students’ awareness of oneself and their surroundings increases as they take on different roles in each session. In the midst of working together with other students, each child can also build on their confidence and communication skills. 

Drama CCA provides its student-members with opportunities to perform in and outside the school. Our members master Drama skills and develop an appreciation for the stage and theatre through the weekly training sessions. The Club stages a play production every year at in-school performances (FANTASIA and Arts Fest). Members attend theatre performances outside school as part of the CCA’s annual learning journey. Selected students take up leadership roles within the club as CCA Leaders. Every year, the Club nominates student-members for SOTA Junior Academy workshops/masterclasses and/or other Drama training workshops outside school. In summary, the Drama Club is a platform that provides a better understanding of the performing arts to students. 

##### **Achievement**

The cast staged Alice in Wonderland – Through the Looking Glass in 2018 and Fantastic Mr Fox in 2019. The Drama Club also collaborated with a Singaporean filmmaker from University of Southern California (USC) in 2020, to work on a short film titled An Island Drifts. Our Drama CCA students involved in the film production participated as background extras for scenes in the film, acting alongside the main actors. Last but not the least, the Drama CCA Club did up a virtual stage production on Charlotte’s Web in July 2021 and performed a play based on Tetsuko Kuroyanagi’s Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window at our school Performing Arts Theatre in 2022. More exciting plans coming up for 2023!
