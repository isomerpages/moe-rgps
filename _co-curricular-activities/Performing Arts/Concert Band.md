#### **Concert Band**

##### **Overview of CCA**

The Concert Band was set up in 1983 and transformed into Symphonic Band in 2005.

The RGPS Symphonic Band is a performing ensemble consisting of several members of the woodwind, brass and percussion families of instruments.

The band provides a variety of platforms within and outside of school which help to boost the students’ confidence in performance and also allows students to showcase their talents. Section practices are conducted during some of the Main band practices. This allows senior members to coach and impart their skills to juniors, thus, bringing out leadership qualities in them.

We welcome all P3 to P5 pupils with or without music background to join our band family.
