### New Media Club

The New Media Club is for pupils from Primary 4 to 6 who enjoy writing, designing and creating new things. If you are interested, the club will equip you with the skills to coordinate and produce content for the school’s newsletters for pupils, Raffles Bubble.  

Over the course of the year, pupils will learn how to lead, research and source for content as well as work in teams. Keep a lookout for our publications and broadcasts!
