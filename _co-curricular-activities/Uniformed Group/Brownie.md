#### **Brownies**

##### **Overview of CCA**
		 
**The Brownies Vision**<br>
All girls are valued and take action to change the world.

**The Brownies mission**<br>
To enable girls and young women to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world

Brownies are guided by a comprehensive 5-Point Programme, which develops them in 5 areas:
* Personal & Social Development – Healthy Me, Courteous Me, Cultured Me
* Home – Home Safety & Duties
* Outdoor – Discovering Nature, A Green World
* Community – My Country, My Neighbourhood, Helper
* International – My Brownie Friend, My World

Brownies CCA members will have the opportunity to learn basic life skills and have a good knowledge about Singapore.  Kindness and helpfulness are key values that will be instilled in every Brownie; this will be achieved by their involvement in fundraising activities, learning of skills and volunteer work.  

Brownies will also get to learn other necessary skills through camps, field trips, fun activities and appropriate tasks or projects to help them acquire their proficiency badges.  

Sixers / Seconds will be provided with ample opportunities to hone their leadership skills as they will be tasked to lead several teamwork-focused activities during the year.  Brownies will learn to work well as a team to make decisions in their groups and engage in meaningful group discussions.

Brownies will continue working for interest badges and awards that will help them develop new skills. Tweenies ( new members who have not been enrolled yet ) will work towards the attainment of the Golden Badge in Term 1 and then continue on the 5-point programme once they are enrolled as Brownies.
