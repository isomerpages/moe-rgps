### Overview

The Girls’ Brigade is one of the oldest Christian uniformed youth organisation for girls in the world. It is an international fellowship represented in over 60 countries.  
In Singapore, it is recognized by the Ministry of Education as a Co-Curricular Activity in primary and secondary schools.  
**The GB Singapore Mission** Developing each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling

*   Every Girl a Leader
*   Every Officer a Servant Leader

**The GB Programme** Activities are centered on 3 key areas:

1.  Leadership Development
2.  Character Development
3.  Service to the Community

Since the humble beginning in 1985, the girls in the 20th Girls’ Brigade (GB) company have forged deep and meaningful friendships as they interact and work together with friends within the school and from other companies. They participate actively in camps, national events and community projects that develop leadership skills and instil moral values.  
Through the course of participation, the pupils develop a strong sense of belonging in the company. Even after graduation, they would return to volunteer as camp assistants to relive the fond memories and continue to pass on the legacy to the new members. The activities at national level are life enriching and purposeful as they enable both girls and officers to be more aware of the needs of the community.
