#### **Girls’ Brigade (P3 to P6)**

##### **Overview of CCA**

**What is the Girls’ Brigade all about?**

The Girls’ Brigade is one of the oldest Uniformed Youth Organisation for Girls in the world. It is an international fellowship, founded as a Christian Organisation, represented in over 60 countries. 

In Singapore, our work as an Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs), is recognized by the Ministry of Education as a Co-Curricular Activity in Primary and Secondary schools.

**The GB Singapore Mission**

The mission of The Brigade is to develop each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling every girl to be a leader, and every officer a servant leader.

**The GB Programme**

The Brigade shall provide activities designed to help girls attain physical, mental and spiritual maturity; encouraging them to express all they have learnt through practical service to the community and the world around them. The Brigade shall do this with the skilled teaching and role-modelling of its Officers, the effective communication of values and effective use of all The Brigade provides through its Programme.

The wearing of a uniform encourages a sense of community, group identity and esprit de corps as members are identifiable as part of something big, despite a person’s socio-economic situation. The uniform teaches each person to have pride in themselves and their appearance.

The GB activities are centered on 3 key areas:
1. Leadership Development
2. Character Development
3. Service to the Community
