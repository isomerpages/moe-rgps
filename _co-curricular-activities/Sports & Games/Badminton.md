**Overview**

Badminton is a sport which promotes coordination, flexibility and balance. It allows a player to improve her psychomotor capabilities as well as sharpens her visual concentration and functions.

There are 2 groups of players in RGPS: School Training Team and CCA Group.

**1. School Training Team**

Pupils selected for the School Training Team train on weekly basis, twice during school terms and 3 to 4 times during the holidays. The structured training grooms our pupils into disciplined, competent and skillful players. Players in the team will have the opportunity to represent the school in competitions depending on their competency level and attendance during trainings.
