#### **Badminton (P3-P6)**

##### **Overview of CCA**

Badminton is a sport which promotes coordination, flexibility and balance. It allows a player to improve her psychomotor capabilities as well as sharpens her visual concentration and functions.

There are 2 groups of players in RGPS: School Team and CCA Group. <br><br>
**1. School Team**<br>
Pupils selected for the School Team train on a weekly basis, twice during school terms and 3 to 4 times during the holidays. The structured training grooms our pupils into disciplined, competent and skillful players. Players in the team will have the opportunity to represent the school in competitions depending on their competency level and attendance during trainings.

**Selection for School Training Team**<br>
Pupils who are keen to join the School Training Team must go through the selection.

Selection will be for P2 & P3 students only. It will be held in Term 4.
<br><br>
**2. CCA Group**<br>
This group is for non-competitive players who wish to acquire basic badminton skills. Pupils will train for 2 hours on Wednesdays with a coach. Those with a flair for badminton may be invited to go for the School Team selection.
