#### **Table Tennis (P3 -P6)**

##### **Overview of CCA**

RGPS Table Tennis develops the pupils in coordination, ball sense, responsiveness and passion for the sport.  We aim to instil in our girls the value of good sportsmanship and to cultivate a love for the sport in each member of the team.

Pupils can participate in Table Tennis CCA from Primary 3 onwards where they will learn basic foot work, strokes and ball skills. As the pupils become more mature and their skills are more developed, they will learn the competitive aspect of the game.

There are 2 groups of players in RGPS: School Training Team and CCA Group.

**School Training Team**<br>
Primary 3 to Primary 6 pupils selected for the School Training Team will train intensively on weekly basis, twice a week during school terms and 3 to 4 times during the holidays. The structured training grooms our pupils into disciplined, competent and skilful players. Players in the team will have the opportunity to represent the school in competitions depending on their competency level and attendance during trainings. They will also undergo a more holistic training regime and expose to friendly matches or tournaments to gain experience.  


**CCA Group**<br>
This group is for Primary 3 to Primary 6 non-competitive players. Pupils meet on every Wednesday to learn the basics of table tennis, spar with one another and enjoy the game of table-tennis. Those who displayed potential for the sport may be invited to go for the School Training Team selection.
