##### **Softball CCA (P3-P6)**

##### **Overview of CCA**

Softball is a game that requires dexterity, fitness, agility, and teamwork. The RGPS Softball CCA aims to instil the value of having good sportsmanship and cultivate a love for the sport in each member of the team. We aim to develop the pupils in their coordination, ball sense, responsiveness, and passion for the sport. During the CCA sessions, the coaches and teachers will develop the pupils in the skills and games concepts required to play Softball either leisurely or competitively. 

The Raffles Girls’ Softball Team consists of three teams - Junior School Team (Primary 3 and 4), Senior School Team (Primary 5 and 6) and the CCA Team (Primary 3-6).

Players in the Junior and Senior School Teams will be selected to participate in the National School Games annually. They regularly train every Tuesday and Thursday under the expert guidance of Coach Regina and Coach Johanna.

The CCA team is a developmental team and is led by Ms Farhani and Mr Yeo. They train every Tuesday. Players from the CCA team who are suitable will be considered for the school team.
