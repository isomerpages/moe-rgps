### Overview

RGPS softball has displayed consistency as a CCA in RGPS. It is a game that requires dexterity, fitness, agility and teamwork. The CCA also aims to instil the value of having good sportsmanship and cultivate a love for the sport in each member of the team. We aim to develop the pupils in their coordination, ball sense, responsiveness and passion for the sport. 

  
Pupils are invited to come for a trial session held annually at P2 level where we identify students to join our School Team. There are two groups of players in RGPS: School Team and CCA Team. 


  
**School Team**

Primary 3 to Primary 6 pupils selected for the School Team will train intensively on a weekly basis, twice a week. Trainings are conducted during the holidays as well. The structured training grooms our pupils into disciplined, competent and skilful players. Players in the team will have the opportunity to represent the school in competitions depending on their competency level and attendance during trainings. They will also undergo a more holistic training regime and are exposed to friendly matches or tournaments to gain experience.

Training Details: Tuesday and Thursday 3pm - 5pm <br>
Venue: School Field <br>
Fee payable: Yes


  
**CCA Team**   <br>
This group is for Primary 3 and 4 non-competitive players. Pupils train once a week to learn the basics of softball, gain knowledge about the game and enjoy the camaraderie with the girls in the CCA. Those who display potential for the sport may be invited to go for the School Team selection.


  
Training Details: Monday 3 – 5 pm  
Venue: School Field<br>
Fee payable: No
