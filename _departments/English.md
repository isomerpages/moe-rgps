## Enrichment (for selected students)

| JUMUN (P5) |  | 
| -------- | -------- |
| Objectives | The programme aims to: <br> 1. sensitise students to global issues (social, environmental, cultural, humanitarian, economic, political etc);<br>2. instil empathy in our students as they view global issues through multiple perspectives (countries which they represent);<br>3. develop students’ critical thinking routines;<br>4. enhance students’ information search & research skills; and<br>5. enhance students’ oracy and communication skills through debates of issues.|
| Programme Outline | JMUN is a multidisciplinary activity where participants take the roles of delegates at the United Nations and engage in constructive discussions on current global issues (social, environmental, cultural, humanitarian, economic, political etc). Participants will be introduced to the working model of the United Nations and work collaboratively in teams to debate on global issues through multiple perspectives. The programme aims to enhance students’ critical thinking, debate, diplomacy, research, writing and oracy skills.|


| AWE <br>(P3 – P4) |  | 
| -------- | -------- |
| Objectives | This programme aims to teach students to:<br>1. explore various poetic forms and structures;<br>2. appreciate and respond to poetry through listening to poetry, reading and writing poetry;<br>3. examine how poets manipulate words for their quality of sound, e.g. rhythm, rhyme, assonance; for their connotations; and for multiple layers of meaning, e.g. through figurative language, ambiguity, etc.;<br>4. analyse how feelings, mood messages and attitudes are conveyed in poetry; and<br>5. demonstrate oral presentation skills through presentation of poems to the class. |
| Programme Outline | Students will explore together the many possibilities for writing and responding to poems. They will be taught poetry vocabulary and skills for reading, appreciating and producing poetry. We will also examine the use of literary devices in poetry such as rhyme, repetition, assonance, etc. Various types of poems will be introduced. Some examples are haiku, diamonte, shape poems, etc. The aim is to get students playing with words and excited about poems. We recognise that the possibilities for connecting through language are endless!|

| AWE (P5) |  | 
| -------- | -------- |
| Objectives | This programme aims to teach students to:<br>1. write creatively outside of the usual composition format;<br>2. develop a character in a story by providing reasons for action and solving a problem;<br>3. develop a plot by describing actions and emotions of characters and using story elements of dialogue, how a character feels, descriptive details; and<br>4. build on a story idea by extending or changing the storyline. |
| Programme Outline | At Primary 5, we will be working with students to write a tall tale which is an exaggerated story. The contrast between fact and fiction in tall tales is enhanced by giving the story a realistic framework and by a deadpan storytelling style. Characters in tall tales were often born from a combination of historical fact and vivid imagination. Pupils will learn how to write in this style of storytelling and in so doing develop their vocabulary and ability to develop a character that is over-the-top and larger than life.<br><br>In this programme, selected P5 students will learn to write a tall tale using knowledge of local heroes from Social Studies lessons and stories of how Singapore was founded. Students will learn to develop characters and describe characters in great detail. Learning how to write a tall tale is useful for nurturing creative thinking where students are encouraged to exaggerate a particular incident to create a tall tale. Critical thinking is also nurtured when students are asked to reflect on the contrast between life in the past and life today, and how it is likely to be in the future.|

| Debate<br>(P5/P6) |  | 
| -------- | -------- |
| Objectives | This programme aims to:<br>1. introduce students to the structure and art of debating;<br>2. train students with rebuttal skills using logic and deal with elements of debating;<br>3. guide students prepare materials for debate competition; and<br>4. teach students to comprehend the meaningful values of working together and derive positive learning experience from participating in debates. |
| Programme Outline | In the Debate Enrichment Programme, students will be exposed to the art of debating and be equipped with oral confidence skills when addressing an audience. During the training, students will learn strategies to overcome nervousness, correct speech, debate structure, points of information, voice projection, confident body language, fallacies of arguments, rebuttal skills and appropriate register.|

# Assessment 

Assessment provides teachers with feedback to help the identify students’ strengths and weaknesses, monitor their progress and adjust instruction to meet their needs.

In promoting students’ learning and developing a wide range of skills, learner strategies, attitudes and behavior, teachers will align assessment with the aims and learning outcomes in the syllabus by encouraging students to:

* listen, read, view, speak, write and represent so that they can demonstrate their language competence for a variety of purposes;
* use English effectively to suit purpose, audience, context and culture in both formal and informal situations; and
* know about language so that they can use it effectively for creative, personal, informational and academic purposed.

Teachers will assess students using different modes of assessment both formally and informally. A meaningful range of assessment modes and tasks includes:

* informal review practices and quizzes;
* performance assessments that assess students’ skills, e.g., staging a role play, readers’ theatre, giving an oral presentation; and
* use of checklists, rubrics with teachers’ comments and students’ reflections
* visual/multi-media productions, audio recordings which record students’ achievements.

**P1 - P2**

There are **no weighted assessments, mid-year examination and end-of-year examination** for the students in the year.

**P3 – P6**

**P3 & 5 Weighted Assessment**

In line with MOE’s direction to reduce school-based assessment and nurture lifelong learners, the school <u>will not have any mid-year examination for P3</u>. This will also provide our students with more time to adjust to the transition and adapt to the new demands of the level.

Although there is no mid-year examination, students’ learning will continue to be monitored and appropriate support will be provided. Current practices to gather information about students’ learning through class discussions, homework, topical tests remain to support students’ development and achievement in learning.

Bite-sized forms of weighted assessments will be conducted in Term 2 and Term 3. The table below shows an overview.

| | Term 1 | Term 2 | Term 3 | Term 4 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
|| - | **Weighted Assessment 1** | **Weighted Assessment 2**| **End-of-Year Examination** |
| Primary 3 & 5 | - | Reading Comprehension | Writing | Refer to details for EYE in the table below. |


| | Mid-Year Examination (MYE) | End-of-Year Examination (EYE) | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Primary 3 | No MYE Only Weighted Assesment | Composition Writing Language Use & Comprehension <br>Listening Comprehension <br> Oral |
|Primary 4 | Composition Writing Language Use & Comprehension<br> Listening Comprehension  | Composition Writing Language Use & Comprehension<br> Listening Comprehension<br> Oral |
|Primary 5 | No MYE Only Weighted Assesment | Composition Writing Language Use & Comprehension<br>Listening Comprehension<br> Oral |
