#### **Assessment**

Assessment is an integral part of the teaching and learning process. A balanced assessment system includes both summative and formative assessments.Â Assessment provides teachers with feedback to help the identify studentsâ€™ strengths and weaknesses, monitor their progress and adjust instruction to meet their needs.

In RGPS, our teachers will assess students using different modes of assessment both formally and informally. A meaningful range of assessment modes and tasks are used : class discussions, classroom discourse, performance tasks, use of checklists, use of rubrics with teachersâ€™ comments and studentsâ€™ reflections.

#### P3 & P5

Bite-sized forms of weighted assessments are conducted in Term 2 and Term 3. The table below shows an overview.
