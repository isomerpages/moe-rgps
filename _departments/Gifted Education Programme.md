### **THE GEP ENRICHMENT MODEL**

The Gifted Education Programme (GEP) curriculum is designed to meet the needs of intellectually gifted students through an enriched curriculum. The GEP curriculum focuses on enrichment and not acceleration.

The enriched curriculum is built on the regular curriculum and differentiated in these 4 areas:

# **DISTINCTIVE GIFTED EDUCATION PROGRAMMES AT RGPS**

  

### 1. Individualised Study Options (ISO)

  

ISO refers to the wide range of project work options available to GEP students. Each ISO emphasises a slightly different set of skills, ranging from research, information technology, inventive thinking to problem-solving skills.  
  
Students will be taught core research skills during the Inquiry Skills lessons in Primary 4 to prepare them for the various ISOs in Primary 5. These skills include:

  

*   Research scoping
*   Information sourcing
*   Data gathering
*   Data analysis
*   Presentation of findings

In Primary 5, students will choose from a range of project options including:

  

*   Individualised Research Study (IRS)
*   Innovation Programme (IvP)
*   Future-Problem Solving Programme (FPSP)

  

_**a) Individualised Research Study (IRS)**_   <br>
The IRS has been a cornerstone of the GEP enriched curriculum for many years. It aims to prepare GEP students to become independent learners and to give them opportunities to explore specific areas of talent and interest in greater depth. The research and presentation skills GEP students acquire as they work on their IRS are invaluable in preparing them for more advanced research work at secondary and tertiary levels. Students who choose IRS as an ISO in P5 will work on a research project based on their personal interests.  
  
In the implementation of ISO, a teacher-mentor supervises a small number of students and provides monitoring and feedback to encourage and guide the students as they complete their projects. Parents can also help by providing support, encouragement and practical assistance such as discussing the project with their child, and helping her get appropriate resources.  
  
ISO projects will not be graded in the report book. Various platforms are available for students to share their findings and project work. Outstanding IRS projects will be showcased in the annual IRS Exhibition.  
  
IRS nurtures students to set individual research goals, plan strategies and self-critique the progress and quality of their work. They learn competencies and dispositions to be independent learners. They also learn to be effective communicators to facilitate their quest for knowledge through exploring ideas with others and communicating their findings and perspectives.  
  
**b) Innovation Programme (IvP)**  <br>
IvP exposes students to critical thinking, ideas generation, development of prototypes, problem-solving and knowledge and experiences beyond the classroom through interaction with innovation mentors from tertiary institutions and other organisations.  
  
_**c) Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP)**_  <br>
FPSP exposes students to critical and creative thinking skills, problem-solving strategies, team work and leadership skills. It encourages students to develop a vision for the future. They conduct research on a series of global topics and learn a six-step creative problem-solving process, culminating in an Action Plan presentation.  
  

### 2. Values-In-Action (VIA) Programme


Our 3-year VIA Programme covers the building of content knowledge, developing affective depth and contributing to society and personal growth.

### 3. Computer Enrichment Programme (CEP)

  

To equip our students with the competencies to navigate and thrive in an increasing complex, digital world, CEP aims to nurture students to use technology in safe, responsible and ethical ways. CEP is compulsory for all P4 students. These are the modules covered:  
  

* Module 1: Introduction to Foundations of Coding
* Module 2: Basic Coding
* Module 3: Physical Computing
* Module 4: Digital Rights and Responsibilities

  

### 4. Pupil Development Programme

The programmes provide students with enriching experiences in the areas of nature, music and art appreciation and the opportunities to learn about teamwork, more about themselves and others through engaging activities beyond the classroom.

# GEP ENRICHED SUBJECTS
  

### English Language

### 1\. The Approach

  

The curriculum is enriched with the adoption of a concept and literature-based approach of teaching. Through this, students will be encouraged to discuss, interpret and evaluate ideas, issues and values. The concepts allow scope for more intellectual activity and creative work. Through exploring fiction and non-fiction, students will pick up critical, creative thinking and literary skills. Emphasis is also placed on the formal teaching of grammar, its usage and vocabulary. Students will also be formally taught reading, listening comprehension and writing skills. The enriched EL curriculum is differentiated in the following aspects/areas:  
  

a) Concept units <br>
b) Study of a novel <br>
c) Extensive Reading Programme (ERP) <br>
d) Reading and Writing <br>
e) Oral Communication <br>
f) Poetry Appreciation
