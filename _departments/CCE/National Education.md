#### **NE Commemorative Events**

National Education, a significant aspect of CCE, comprises a wide range of school efforts that help students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans, understand the realities and challenges unique to our nation and foster a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore. Having a strong sense of belonging, reality and hope will motivate our students to be active citizens. While they seek to achieve their personal life goals, they also see themselves as playing a contributory role in their families, school, and immediate communities. NE in CCE aims to be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional and global issues.
