#### **NE Commemorative Events**

National Education, a significant aspect of CCE, comprises a wide range of school efforts that help students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans, understand the realities and challenges unique to our nation and foster a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore. Having a strong sense of belonging, reality and hope will motivate our students to be active citizens. While they seek to achieve their personal life goals, they also see themselves as playing a contributory role in their families, school, and immediate communities. NE in CCE aims to be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional and global issues.

#### **Commemorating of 4 NE events:**

##### 1. Total Defence Day (TDD)
TDD is commemorated every year to remind us that we must defend Singapore ourselves. Lessons and activities to commemorate the event will focus on helping students to learn that Singapore is our country and home, and we belong here. We have a part to play to keep everyone safe.

##### 2. International Friendship Day (IFD)
This day is dedicated to the understanding of Singapore’s relations with her neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims to nurture in our students the spirit of friendship and partnership among different countries and people and to appreciate diverse cultures, different perspectives and ideas. It helps students to recognise and learn about the ASEAN Member States (e.g. their national flags, flowers, landmarks, languages) and how their respective national flowers reflect the values and beliefs across ASEAN. Students also understand about how ASEAN Member States work together for growth, development, peace and prosperity in the region.

##### 3. Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 
Students are reminded of the importance of maintaining racial and religious harmony in our country on this day. They will be guided to understand the importance of appreciating the richness of Singapore’s ethnic diversity by learning about the different customs observed by their friends and to find commonalities in their practices. They will also learn to be aware of current local and global events, and what they may mean to us.

##### 4. National Day
The National Day celebration provides a good opportunity for our students to reflect on how far Singapore has come since our independence in 1965 and understand that none of this would have been possible without sheer grit and determination, a forward- looking government and unity among Singaporeans. <br><br>
Students will be engaged in celebratory activities that help them to understand that Singapore is their home, invoke the feeling of joy and pride as well as develop a sense of belonging as a member of the Singapore society. <br><br>
They will also learn that our National Symbols (the National Flag, Anthem and Pledge) represent the nation’s collective aspirations or wishes of working together to make Singapore a better home for all.  Besides learning why National Day is celebrated and what they can do to be a part of the celebration, students will also explore their national identity by reflecting on their experiences of living in Singapore and sharing their hopes for Singapore’s future. <br><br>
Students will understand that there are various aspects of Singapore that are uniquely ours. Singaporeans and these unique aspects make up our Singaporean identity. 

##### P5 NE Show
Since 1997, the National Education (NE) Show has been organised to instill a sense of patriotism in students and to bring across the significance of our National Day. Every year, the Primary 5 students will have the privilege to participate in this event which aims to inculcate NE values in our students.
