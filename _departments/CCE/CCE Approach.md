The CCE acronym **MAGICAL** (motivating all to grow in character and love) guides the planning and implementation of the CCE Programme in the school. We strive to motivate the pupils through bringing about their awareness of values and social and emotional competencies by explicit teaching (Head), engaging their love for self, family, peers, community and country (Heart) and lastly, contributing back to the society by providing service for the School or external community (Hands). CCE approach in RGPS also takes into consideration the alignment between the School values and CCE core values (Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony). Upon completion of the education in RGPS, we would nurture the RGPS Girl who is a Creative Thinker, a Life-long Learner and a Value-based Leader.

The explicit teaching of the School values, CCE Core values and social and emotional competencies is carried out through

* CCE lessons

*  Form Teacher Guidance Programme (FTGP)

* Cyber Wellness Programme (CW)

* Education and Career Guidance Programme (ECG)

* Sexuality Education (SEd)

The application and reinforcement of the values and social and emotional competencies is facilitated through the _Experiential Programmes_:

* Values in Action (VIA)

* Co-curricular Activities (CCA)

* PAL

* National Education

### **Goal and Learning Outcomes**


The goal of CCE is to inculcate values and build competencies in our pupils to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens. CCE in RGPS focuses on motivating all to grow in character and love to grow progressively from self to peers, then to school and finally translation of the growth to serve the community.(Refer to Figure 3 and Figure 3.1)

The Learning Outcomes (LOs) of CCE state what we want our pupils to learn and attain. The CCE values are embedded in the eight LOs. LOs 1 to 4 depict different aspects of character building that are interrelated and feature social and emotional competencies. LOs 5 to 8 are guided by key tenets of 21st century citizenship and arranged according to attributes of citizenship such as identity, culture, and active, responsible engagement as a member of society
