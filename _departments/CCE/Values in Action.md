# Values in Action 

**Objective**

The VIA aims to nurture our pupils to be socially responsible and to help them understand that every Singaporean has a role in enhancing the well-being of the community and the country. The VIA programme of the school aims to instil among our pupils the ability to take care of the common property and the need to reach out to the less fortunate in our society.

Each pupil will be given an opportunity to be involved in community work. She will learn to take care of the school property, look after her fellow schoolmates and eventually reach out to the less fortunate. The lower primary pupils will learn to take care of the school environment and their younger schoolmates. For upper primary pupils, VIA places a greater focus on pupils acquiring values and encourages pupils to identify and understand community issues, initiate action among their peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others.
