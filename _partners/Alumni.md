### **RGPS CARES – Circle of Alumnae to Reach out, Exchange and Support!**

If you are an old RGPS Girl, we welcome you to join the RGPS Alumni Association (AA) as a Life Member.  Get connected with your old classmates from RGPS, exchange information with AAs with girls already in RGPS and help create memories for the next generations of RGPS Girls.  Be part of RGPS Circle of Alumnae to Reach out, Exchange and Support – RGPS CARES!

**For those whose girls are already in RGPS**, we hope you could join as AA member and work together with the committee to shape and create programs for our girls!  Being already a mummy of a RGPS Girl, you know what our girls like/want.  We need resources like you!

**For old RGPS Girls who are looking to enrol your girls in your alma mater**, join us and get connected through these activities that we plan for our new P1s every year.  Having gone through the (old and new) system ourselves, we understand and can address your queries:

**1)**      **School Tour on AGM day**

Everyone in the family get a rare chance to visit the school which the mummies attended and hear from the school management and RGPS AA members on Life@RGPS

**2)**      **Pre-P1 Gathering**

The K2s get to know each other through play before they start primary school the next year.  Current P1 or higher-primary RGPS AA mummies will also join in and share their experiences

**3)**       **P1 Welcome Gifts**

To mark the start of our P1s’ 6-year journey in RGPS, RGSP AA members work together to plan and create special Welcome Gifts when our new P1s start Term 1

Please note that the previous Primary 1 registration Phases 2A(1) and 2A(2) have been combined into a single Phase 2A starting from the 2022 P1 registration.
