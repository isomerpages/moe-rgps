#### **Introduction**

RGPS was established as a full-fledged primary school in 1959 and was one of the two primary schools to pilot the Gifted Education Programme in 1984. We began with a class of 31 pupils at Primary 4 but we have about 150 pupils from Primary 4 to 6 now.

The GEP curriculum is an enriched curriculum designed to meet the needs of GEP students. The enriched curriculum covers the same content areas as those in the mainstream but is extended in breadth and depth. GEP students will learn skills for independent inquiry and are encouraged to do explorations on self-selected areas of interest.
