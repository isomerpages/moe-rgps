### Programme for Active Learning

PAL is to provide the platforms for experiential learning and opportunities for learning experiences to acquire a range of skills as well as interaction with their peers, thereby developing confidence in the pupils. Through PAL, we aimed that the pupils are able to exhibit confidence in what they do and and express themselves effectively, exhibit curiosity and positive attitudes to learn as well as enjoying group experiences and teamwork.

In RGPS, the design of PAL takes into account the knowledge, values and attitudes that the school wants to develop in a RGPS Girl – A Creative Thinker, A Life-Long Learner and A Value-Based Leader by employing the Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies, the 21st Century Competencies and disposition in a RGPS Girl.

These learning will be carried out through the modules of PAL such as Sports and Games, Visual Arts, Outdoor Education and Performing Arts. Each module will run weekly for 7 lessons. In each lesson, pupils will go through a reflection on the learning experiences and sharing their experiences with the class.
