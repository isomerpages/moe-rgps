PAL provides the platforms for experiential learning and opportunities for learning experiences to acquire a range of skills as well as interaction with their peers, thereby developing confidence in the pupils. Through PAL, we aim to develop confidence in the students in what they do, express themselves effectively, exhibit curiosity and have positive attitudes to learn and work as a team.  
  
In RGPS, the design of PAL takes into account the knowledge, values and attitudes that the school wants to develop in a RGPS Girl â€“ A Creative Thinker, A Life-Long Learner and A Value-Based Leader by employing the Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies, the 21st Century Competencies and dispositions in an RGPS Girl.  
  
There are 4 PAL modules - Sports and Games, Visual Arts, Outdoor Education and Performing Arts. Each module comprises of 7 weekly lessons. In each lesson, students end with a reflection of the learning experiences and they share these with the class.  
  
During Non-Pal weeks, Life skills, social skills and character development programmes are conducted to ensure students are equipped with the right skills and values to be future ready.
