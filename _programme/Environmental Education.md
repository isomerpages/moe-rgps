# Get Green & Love Earth

At Raffles Girlsâ€™ Primary School, our goal is to nurture every pupil to become a steward of the environment. We take pride in making life better for others by taking a proactive approach to protecting the environment for current and future generations. Through environmental education, our pupils are empowered to build a better life for people, animals and the environment.

The pictures below show how the pupils get green and love Earth.

| Why is the Earth sad    | Is it because our oceans are polluted with plastic trash     | Or is it because we are mindless about our plastic consumption     |

At RGPS, our goal is to nurture every RGPS pupil to become a steward of the environment. We believe that part of making life better for others is to take a proactive approach to protecting the environment for current and future generations. Through the various projects and initiatives implemented throughout RGPS, we aim to meet these 3 objectives:

1. To increase awareness of environmental issues among pupils and staff
2. To maximise recycling
3. To minimise the use of non-renewable resources

To achieve these objectives, RGPS adopts a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, the teachers infuse environmental topics into the curriculum by teaching about it explicitly. Second, there are a variety of structures in place to ensure consistency and sustainability of our environmental efforts. Third, we engage stakeholders to build an RGPS community that champions sustainability. Fourth, RGPS sets Key Performance Indicators to ensure the efficient and optimal utilisation of resources.

The pictures below provide a glimpse into the various approaches that RGPS takes.
