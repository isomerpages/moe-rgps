# Get Green & Love Earth

At Raffles Girlsâ€™ Primary School, our goal is to nurture every pupil to become a steward of the environment. We take pride in making life better for others by taking a proactive approach to protecting the environment for current and future generations. Through environmental education, our pupils are empowered to build a better life for people, animals and the environment.

The pictures below show how the pupils get green and love Earth.
