The School Song was composed during Miss Ida Goh's tenure as the Principal of RGPS in the 1960s. During this period, Miss Goh requested for all the teachers to think of the lyrics for the School Song. It was then that Mrs Patricia M Tan’s concepts of the lyrics were approved. Together with the musical help of Miss Ng Chiau Kong, they composed the school song that you hear today.
