<p>This year marks a significant milestone for Raffles Girls’ Primary School.&nbsp;
We are delighted to share that RGPS is celebrating 65 years as a primary
school.&nbsp; Our theme for this joyous occasion is “Glowing Memories,
Growing Together”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At RGPS, we take immense pride in our unity as one RGPS community, cherishing
each moment as we strive forth together facing challenges with unwavering
strength and dedication. As we continue in our journey of growth in character
and wisdom, we are excited to share this remarkable journey with you. We
look forward to create more glowing memories as we navigate this special
year together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To celebrate this special occasion, there will be fringe activities through
the year like dedication of well-wishes, tree-planting and celebrations
on Children’s Day. More details will be provided nearer the date of these
events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key highlight would be the return of Fantasia 2024: A Magical Journey
Through Soundscapes, a celebratory showcase of the talents of our school’s
performing arts groups. We would like to invite you to be part of this
happy occasion.</p>
