#### **Background**
Family Matters @ School (formerly known as School Family Education), is supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to provide parents with access to family life programmes that enable them to better connect with their children. RGPS has been on board this programme since 1 April 2006.


#### **Vision**

Family Matters @ School adopts a holistic family learning model to equip parents with effective parenting skills and train them to be parent facilitators. It also looks into providing students with life skills training.


The parent-child relationship has much impact on the child’s academic achievements and behaviours, regardless of socio-economic status, ethnic/ racial background or parents’ education level. Hence, Family Matters @ School aims to reinforce the bonding of every family through a series of initiatives.


#### **Mission of Family Matters @ School in RGPS**

**For Parents to**

* Better understand their children

* Forge stronger parent-child (family) relationships

* Be a Family Life Education advocate and participate in parent support groups

**For Students to**
