## Enrichment (for selected students)

| JUMUN (P5) |  | 
| -------- | -------- |

The programme aims to enhance students’ critical thinking, debate, diplomacy, research, writing and oracy skills.|


| AWE <br>(P3 – P4) |  | 
| -------- | -------- |
| Objectives | This programme aims to teach students to:<br>1. explore various poetic forms and structures;<br>2. appreciate and respond to poetry through listening to poetry, reading and writing poetry;<br>3. examine how poets manipulate words for their quality of sound, e.g. rhythm, rhyme, assonance; for their connotations; and for multiple layers of meaning, e.g. through figurative language, ambiguity, etc.;<br>4. analyse how feelings, mood messages and attitudes are conveyed in poetry; and<br>5. demonstrate oral presentation skills through presentation of poems to the class. |
| Programme Outline | Students will explore together the many possibilities for writing and responding to poems. They will be taught poetry vocabulary and skills for reading, appreciating and producing poetry. We will also examine the use of literary devices in poetry such as rhyme, repetition, assonance, etc. Various types of poems will be introduced. Some examples are haiku, diamonte, shape poems, etc. The aim is to get students playing with words and excited about poems. We recognise that the possibilities for connecting through language are endless!|

| AWE (P5) |  | 
| -------- | -------- |
| Objectives | This programme aims to teach students to:<br>1. write creatively outside of the usual composition format;<br>2. develop a character in a story by providing reasons for action and solving a problem;<br>3. develop a plot by describing actions and emotions of characters and using story elements of dialogue, how a character feels, descriptive details; and<br>4. build on a story idea by extending or changing the storyline. |
| Programme Outline | At Primary 5, we will be working with students to write a tall tale which is an exaggerated story. The contrast between fact and fiction in tall tales is enhanced by giving the story a realistic framework and by a deadpan storytelling style. Characters in tall tales were often born from a combination of historical fact and vivid imagination. Pupils will learn how to write in this style of storytelling and in so doing develop their vocabulary and ability to develop a character that is over-the-top and larger than life.<br><br>In this programme, selected P5 students will learn to write a tall tale using knowledge of local heroes from Social Studies lessons and stories of how Singapore was founded. Students will learn to develop characters and describe characters in great detail. Learning how to write a tall tale is useful for nurturing creative thinking where students are encouraged to exaggerate a particular incident to create a tall tale. Critical thinking is also nurtured when students are asked to reflect on the contrast between life in the past and life today, and how it is likely to be in the future.|
