Assessment provides teachers with feedback to help the identify students’ strengths and weaknesses, monitor their progress and adjust instruction to meet their needs.

In promoting students’ learning and developing a wide range of skills, learner strategies, attitudes and behavior, teachers will align assessment with the aims and learning outcomes in the syllabus by encouraging students to:

* listen, read, view, speak, write and represent so that they can demonstrate their language competence for a variety of purposes;
* use English effectively to suit purpose, audience, context and culture in both formal and informal situations; and
* know about language so that they can use it effectively for creative, personal, informational and academic purposed.

Teachers will assess students using different modes of assessment both formally and informally. A meaningful range of assessment modes and tasks includes:

* informal review practices and quizzes;
* performance assessments that assess students’ skills, e.g., staging a role play, readers’ theatre, giving an oral presentation; and
* use of checklists, rubrics with teachers’ comments and students’ reflections
* visual/multi-media productions, audio recordings which record students’ achievements.

**P1 - P2**

There are **no weighted assessments, mid-year examination and end-of-year examination** for the students in the year.

**P3 – P6**

**P3 & 5 Weighted Assessment**

In line with MOE’s direction to reduce school-based assessment and nurture lifelong learners, the school <u>will not have any mid-year examination for P3</u>. This will also provide our students with more time to adjust to the transition and adapt to the new demands of the level.

Although there is no mid-year examination, students’ learning will continue to be monitored and appropriate support will be provided. Current practices to gather information about students’ learning through class discussions, homework, topical tests remain to support students’ development and achievement in learning.

Bite-sized forms of weighted assessments will be conducted in Term 2 and Term 3. The table below shows an overview.
