### **Information for Students**
Borrowing polices 
Pupils can borrow library books using:

	photocopy of their student concession card 

We have a no-card-no-borrowing policy. Pupils should not lend their student concession card to anyone else. They will be held responsible for all books borrowed using their student concession card. 
Overdue Items
While there are no charges for all overdue books, we urge pupils to return book promptly so that other can have access to the books. Borrowing privileges will be suspended until all overdue books are returned.
Lost / Damaged Items
Lost or damaged books are to be replaced by books of the same value by the same author. Receipt should be presented together with the replacement books for verification. No cash payment will be accepted.
